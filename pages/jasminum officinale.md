- **data**
	- **sun requirements**: jasminum officinale thrives in full sun to partial shade, though it prefers bright sunlight for optimal flowering.
	- **water requirements**: it requires moderate watering, with well-drained soil. the plant should not be waterlogged and prefers slightly dry conditions between waterings.
	- **soil ph**: jasmine grows best in slightly acidic to neutral soils, with a ph range of 6.0 to 7.5.
	- **plant/roles in permaculture guilds**: in permaculture, jasminum officinale can be used as a trellis plant to create vertical layers in a garden. its flowers attract beneficial insects, including pollinators, while its dense growth can provide cover for wildlife. jasmine can also be planted near fruiting plants that benefit from increased pollinator activity.
	- **height in meters**: jasmine can grow up to 4-6 meters in height, depending on its support structure and growing conditions.
	- **spacing in meters**: plants should be spaced about 1.5 to 2 meters apart to allow for adequate airflow and growth.
	- **germination days**: jasmine seeds typically take 10-15 days to germinate, though propagation is more commonly done through cuttings.
	- **strata**: jasminum officinale is considered a mid-level to overstory climber, often growing vertically through other plants.
	- **days to maturity**: it takes about 1-2 years for the plant to start flowering under ideal conditions, though full maturity can take several years.
- **plant, harvest, pruning calendar in months**: jasmine is best planted in early spring or fall. pruning should be done after flowering to maintain shape and promote future blooms. flowers can be harvested during their blooming season, which typically occurs from late spring through summer.
- **good neighbors**: good companion plants for jasmine include herbs like lavender, rosemary, and thyme, which benefit from similar growing conditions. jasmine also grows well near pollinator-friendly plants such as sunflowers and marigolds.
- **bad neighbors**: jasmine should not be planted near plants that require deep watering, such as water-loving vegetables, as its preference for well-drained soil and moderate water may create competition.
  
  jasminum officinale is a valuable plant in gardens, aromatherapy, and traditional medicine, prized for its flowers and therapeutic benefits. its role in permaculture as a pollinator attractor and vertical grower makes it a versatile plant in diverse environments.
