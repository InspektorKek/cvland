- ## abstract
	- in this document
	- i propose blueprint mechanisms and token model
	- for solving major root problems of legacy societies
- ## tldr
	- | problem | mechanism |
	  | overpopulation | staking mechanism for residentship |
	  |no collective insurance | capital driven basic income |
	  | broken ecology | automated slashing driven by sensor network |
	  | lack of freedoms | public good infrastructure owned by community |
	  | inefficient public goods | advanced decision making |
- ## mechanisms
	- staking mechanism for residentship
		- mechanism propose self regulation of density
		- overpopulation of certain areas is likely the biggest problem of our society
		- leads to inability of inhabitants to produce enough energy and food to sustain themselves
		- results in majority of problems including crime, poverty and modern types of slavery
		- residentship is granted for staking amount of tokens defined by community
		- amount is defined by community demand for density
		- the more demand for more dense residentship, the higher price of residentship
	- capital driven basic income
		- inflation flow to staking residents
		- this approach tackles issues of community insurance
		- remove necessity to inefficient forms of "free" basic income
		- guaranteed capital based income for all residents sets a flow on quality of life in different life situations
	- public good infrastructure owned by community
		- [[public goods]] such as roads, water system, data system and others
		- must be result of collective ownership, investments and management
		- all community services are paid in a token
		- token is burned on usage
	- automated slashing driven by sensor network
		- soil, sound, light, water and air pollution can be measured by sensor network
		- community define rules of slashing for pollution and misbehavour
		- sensor network slash stake of residents based on this measures and feedback from residents
		- approach remove necessity for enforcement system for the majority of cases
	- advanced decision making
		- is crucial for sustainability and growth
		- crowd investments is the key for efficient public good infrustructure
		- privacy of voting is vital for truthful decisions
		- quadratic voting scheme is needed for balancing outcomes
		- conviction voting approach is a good opportunity for in time decision optimization
		- yuma type of redistribution demonstrate amazing outcomes
		- its important that community iterate and constantly improve decision making
- ## token model
	- initial distribution: proportionally to land ownership on the start
	- mint: basic income defined by community. 0.01% on the start
	- burn: payments for services and infrastructure
	- lock: residency staking
	- pay: small community defined tax on every transfer. 0.1% on the start
