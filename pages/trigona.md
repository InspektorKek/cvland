- **General Characteristics**: Trigona is a genus within the tribe Meliponini, commonly referred to as stingless bees. These bees are found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, including Australia, Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Americas. They are characterized by their relatively small size and, as their common name suggests, an inability to sting, relying instead on other defensive mechanisms like biting or releasing a sticky resin when threatened.
- **Social Structure**: Like honeybees, stingless bees are eusocial, living in complex societies with a queen, workers, and drones. Their colonies tend to be smaller than those of *Apis mellifera*, ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand individuals.
- **Honey Production**: Stingless bees produce honey, often referred to as "meliponine honey," which is stored in unique, pot-like structures within their nests. This honey is highly valued in some cultures for its taste and purported medicinal properties, although the quantity produced by a single colony is much less than that of typical honeybee hives. The harvesting of meliponine honey is practiced in traditional apiculture in various parts of the world, including Central and South America and Southeast Asia.
- **Pollination**: Stingless bees are important pollinators in tropical ecosystems, contributing to the biodiversity and functioning of these environments. They have been used in some regions for the pollination of crops, similar to *Apis mellifera*.

- While both **Trigona** and **Apis mellifera** are valuable for their pollination services and their unique contributions to their ecosystems, *Apis mellifera* is more widely utilized for commercial honey production and agricultural pollination due to its higher honey yield and the established practices surrounding beekeeping with this species. Conservation and sustainable management practices are important for both groups to ensure their survival and the health of ecosystems they support.
