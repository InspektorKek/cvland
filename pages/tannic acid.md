- [[tannic acid]] is a type of [[hydrolyzable tannin]] found in plants, particularly in [[bark]], [[fruits]], and [[leaves]]. it is known for its [[astringent]] properties and is widely used for its [[antioxidant]], [[anti-inflammatory]], and [[antimicrobial]] effects.
- ### chemical properties
	- **molecular weight**: 1701.2 g/mol (approximate, depending on the source)
	- **density**: not widely reported
	- **melting point**: decomposes before melting
	- **solubility**: highly soluble in water, alcohol, and acetone
	- **chemical formula**: C₇₆H₅₂O₄₆ (average composition)
- ### usefulness in medicine
	- tannic acid is used to treat [[diarrhea]] and [[intestinal inflammation]] due to its [[astringent effects]].
	- it promotes [[wound healing]] and is used in dressings for [[burns]] and [[cuts]].
	- its [[antioxidant]] properties protect cells from oxidative damage and slow the [[aging process]].
	- tannic acid is studied for its potential role in preventing and managing [[cancer]] and [[cardiovascular diseases]].
	- it supports [[oral health]] by reducing plaque formation and bacterial growth.
- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- tannic acid exhibits strong antimicrobial properties by binding to microbial proteins, disrupting membranes, and [[inhibiting enzymes]].
