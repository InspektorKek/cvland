		- the cost of one kw/h renewable solar or wind is something ~1k$ per kw/h
		- your needs: 3-5 kwt per hour of maximum capacity
	- you need water
		- on average 1 sq.m of land produce 0.3-3 m3 of water per year
		- ~50 m3 for home demands excluding gardening would be enouth
		- gather, clean it and drink it
	- you need plants
		- plants are amazing!
		- they can produce everything you need
		- food, medicine, heat, cosmetics, timber, textile and more
- modeling demonstrates that you need just 14 species on 500-1000 m2 of land to grow everything you need
- 100% autonomy allows you to aim your attention inside, not outside
- existing system wouldn't let you rest
- but autonomy is hard! you need to learn a lot
	- how soil works
