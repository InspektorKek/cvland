	- Damocles eagerly accepted and was seated at a lavish banquet, enjoying all the splendor and opulence of the ruler's life.
	- However, Dionysius had arranged for a sharp sword to be suspended above the throne by a single horsehair, which could snap at any moment. When Damocles saw the precarious sword, he could no longer enjoy the pleasures of the banquet and asked to be relieved of his new position, having learned that with great power comes great peril.
