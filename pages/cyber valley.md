- ## why
	- we live in an amazing time when people, tech, and nature can work together for the betterment of our planet and civilization
	- but unfortunately, everything is happening the other way around
	- the scope of the problem is so complex that building from scratch feels like the only way to go
	- we plan to redesign all fundamental processes symbiotically, while also fixing our consumer culture and habits along the way
		- we have the ability to harness clean energy
		- we want to eat nutrient rich food
		- we need to have clean and calm environment
		- we wish our children to have personal development path
		- we love watching stars every day
	- there are still so much that the greedy and selfish civilization has taken
	- all we do, must add to the planet, not exploit it
	- so we have decided to reclaim responsibility for our future to create a happier, longer, and more fulfilling life
- ## status
	- we, [master](https://cyb.ai/@master) and [joy](https://cyb.ai/@joy), began this project in 2021 by acquiring land in one of the most beautiful and pristine locations in Bali
	- Since then we have consolidated ~38 ha of land at the foot of [Sanghyang volcano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CdD8vRYHrWkpTGYj6)
	- We built the first completely offgrid home in the region and moved here in July 2023.
	- Now we are learning how to live sustainably in order to understand how to scale the project to a bigger community without harming a cyber valley beautiful environment.
	- The project is deliberately funded with our own investments to ensure that business needs do not compromise the core idea:
	  
	  > Outstanding environment for planet aware people ðŸ–– to live and prosper
- ## sharing is caring
	- Everything we learn we publish in [logseq](https://logseq.com/) knowledge graph notation at [cv.land](https://cv.land)
	- We believe this knowledge and experience will help you establish sustainable network state or autonomous startup society
- ## future
	- Several amazing people and leading bali entrepreneurs have been independently joined the project immediately making it not only one of the biggest Bali developments, but unique on the global scale
	- The decentralized nature and philosophy behind the project, favorable climate for relocation to Indonesia, coupled with affordable land, and an unbelievable environment, will likely make Cyber Valley the leading development in Bali and the foundation of a global movement in the coming years.
	- We are going to marry tech and nature here doing our best to avoid repeating the development mistakes of our predecessors.
	- In november we are going to launch 2 week educational program for people who want to do the same as us: connect with nature and planet without sacrifice of civilization goodness
