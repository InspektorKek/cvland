- [[anthocyanins]] are [[water-soluble pigments]] belonging to the [[flavonoid]] group, responsible for the [[red]], [[purple]], and [[blue]] colors in many [[fruits]], [[vegetables]], and [[flowers]]. they are known for their potent [[antioxidant]], [[anti-inflammatory]], and [[anti-cancer]] properties.
- ### chemical properties
	- **molecular weight**: varies depending on the specific anthocyanin (e.g., cyanidin-3-glucoside: 449.39 g/mol).
	- **density**: not widely reported.
	- **melting point**: decomposes before melting.
	- **solubility**: highly soluble in water and slightly soluble in alcohol.
	- **chemical formula**: varies; general structure includes a flavylium cation (C₁₅H₁₁O⁺).
- ### usefulness in medicine
	- anthocyanins act as powerful [[antioxidants]], neutralizing free radicals and reducing [[oxidative stress]], which helps prevent chronic diseases.
	- they promote [[cardiovascular health]] by improving blood vessel elasticity and reducing inflammation.
	- anthocyanins support [[eye health]] by protecting against retinal damage and improving vision.
	- they have [[anti-cancer]] properties, showing potential in inhibiting tumor growth and inducing apoptosis.
	- anthocyanins contribute to [[skin health]] by reducing UV-induced damage and enhancing hydration.
- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- anthocyanins exhibit antimicrobial properties by disrupting microbial membranes and inhibiting bacterial growth.
