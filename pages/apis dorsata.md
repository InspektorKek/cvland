alias:: giant honeybee

- Found primarily in forested areas of South and Southeast Asia, *Apis dorsata* builds large single-comb nests in the open, often on tree branches or under cliff overhangs. These bees are known for their aggressive behavior when disturbed and produce significant amounts of honey, although their nesting habits make honey collection challenging and risky.
