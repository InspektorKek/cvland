- [[lysine]] is an essential [[amino acid]] found in protein-rich foods such as [[meat]], [[fish]], [[eggs]], [[dairy]], and [[legumes]]. it is crucial for [[protein synthesis]], [[tissue repair,]] and the [[production of enzymes]], [[hormones]], and [[antibodies]].
- ### chemical properties
	- **molecular weight**: 146.19 g/mol
	- **density**: 1.7 g/cm³
	- **melting point**: 224°C (decomposes)
	- **solubility**: highly soluble in water; slightly soluble in alcohol
	- **chemical formula**: C₆H₁₄N₂O₂
- ### usefulness in medicine
	- lysine supports [[collagen synthesis]], making it essential for [[skin health]], [[wound healing]], and [[maintaining strong bones]].
	- it is used to treat and prevent [[cold sores]] caused by the [[herpes simplex virus]] by inhibiting viral replication.
	- lysine plays a role in [[calcium absorption]] and retention, helping to prevent [[osteoporosis]].
	- it supports [[immune function]] by aiding in the [[production of antibodies]].
	- lysine may help manage [[anxiety]] and [[stress]] by [[modulating neurotransmitter levels]].
- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- lysine itself does not have direct antimicrobial effects but supports immune responses and cellular repair, indirectly enhancing the body’s defense [[against infections]].
