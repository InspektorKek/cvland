- since [[game of freedom]] announcement a lot have been happened
-
- what we learned?
- we have a lot of legal constraints which brings serious risks we unable to handle
	- one example is work of foreigners
	- another is ability to do advertisement
- without these the whole point of effort is meaningless
- also we got several applications and feedback from several people opinion of which we value high
- its also clear that current design of incentives and event structure does not solve progect tactics
- in short given current constraints focus of incentives must be on staying in the valley, not on maximizing amount of participants
- so we decide to completely restructure [[game of freedom]] for bootcamp
- we certainly come back to the previous idea after we spend some time on legal engineering
- now let me propose the new rules
-
- bootcamp is now survival game with individual and collective incentives
- bootcamp structure itself does not changes
	- its the same free two week eduhealth program
	- starting on the new and full moon
- you can [[apply for bootcamp]] any time
- bootcamp pilot start on 1 of november 54 [[mt]]
- the main prize: 42 ares of land will be split equally between bootcampers who will stay in camp after [[final]]
- every full and new moon the community decide on participants for the following bootcamp after next
	- 50% of votes between bootcampers
	- 50% of votes between habitats
-
- we have limited amount of [[tents]]
- which are almost filled with passionate people we met recently
- accordingly we updated information on the following pages
	- [[game of freedom]]
	- [[bootcamp/v0]]
