			- ### bacteria
				- **[[staphylococcus aureus]]** (including methicillin-resistant strains, MRSA):
					- **harm:** causes skin infections, abscesses, respiratory infections, and food poisoning. MRSA strains are particularly concerning due to their resistance to multiple antibiotics, leading to difficult-to-treat infections​ ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/17/6/6305))​​ ([SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-3120-7_15))​.
				- **[[escherichia coli]]**:
					- **harm:** can cause urinary tract infections, gastroenteritis, and in severe cases, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which can lead to kidney failure​ ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/17/6/6305))​​ ([SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-3120-7_15))​.
				- **[[klebsiella pneumoniae]]**:
					- **harm:** responsible for pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis. it is particularly dangerous in healthcare settings due to its resistance to many antibiotics​ ([SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-3120-7_15))​.
				- **[[enterococcus hirae]]**:
					- **harm:** can cause urinary tract infections, bacteremia, endocarditis, and wound infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals. it is known for its resistance to several antibiotics​ ([Gavin Publishers](https://www.gavinpublishers.com/article/view/a-science-review-of-selected-essential-oils-and-their-botanical-ingredients.-focus-on-essential-oils-used-for-respiratory-and-calming))​.
				- **[[salmonella enterica]]**:
					- **harm:** leads to salmonellosis, characterized by diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. severe cases can result in bloodstream infections and require hospitalization​ ([SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-3120-7_15))​​ ([Gavin Publishers](https://www.gavinpublishers.com/article/view/a-science-review-of-selected-essential-oils-and-their-botanical-ingredients.-focus-on-essential-oils-used-for-respiratory-and-calming))​.
				- **[[streptococcus species]]**:
					- **harm:** includes streptococcus pyogenes (causes strep throat, impetigo, and necrotizing fasciitis) and streptococcus pneumoniae (causes pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis)​ ([SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-3120-7_15))​​ ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-9992/12/1/11))​.
			- ### fungi
				- **[[candida albicans]]**:
					- **harm:** causes candidiasis, which can affect the mouth (oral thrush), genital area (yeast infection), and bloodstream (invasive candidiasis). it is particularly dangerous for immunocompromised individuals​ ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/17/6/6305))​​ ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/11/738))​.
				- **[[aspergillus flavus]]**:
					- **harm:** responsible for aspergillosis, which can affect the lungs and other organs, leading to allergic reactions, lung infections, and in severe cases, systemic infections. it also produces aflatoxins, which are carcinogenic​ ([Gavin Publishers](https://www.gavinpublishers.com/article/view/a-science-review-of-selected-essential-oils-and-their-botanical-ingredients.-focus-on-essential-oils-used-for-respiratory-and-calming))​.
				- **[[aspergillus nidulans]]**:
					- **harm:** similar to aspergillus flavus, it can cause aspergillosis, affecting the lungs and other organs, and is particularly harmful to immunocompromised patients​ ([Gavin Publishers](https://www.gavinpublishers.com/article/view/a-science-review-of-selected-essential-oils-and-their-botanical-ingredients.-focus-on-essential-oils-used-for-respiratory-and-calming))​.
				- **[[cryptococcus neoformans]]**:
					- **harm:** causes cryptococcosis, which primarily affects the lungs and central nervous system, leading to pneumonia and meningitis. it is a significant threat to individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS​ ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/17/6/6305))​.
