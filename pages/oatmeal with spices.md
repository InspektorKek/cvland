- ingredient estimation per person
	- 1/2 cup rolled oats
	- 1 cup water or milk (or a mix of both)
	- 1 teaspoon turmeric
	- 1/3 teaspoon black pepper (enhances turmeric absorption)
	- 1/3 teaspoon ground ginger
	- 1/4 teaspoon ground clove
	- 1 tablespoon ghee (to be added after serving)
- instructions
	- in a small saucepan, heat the water or milk until it starts to simmer gently.
	- add the rolled oats, reduce the heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes or until the desired consistency is reached.
	- stir in the turmeric, black pepper, ginger, and clove. Mix well to combine.
	- cook for another 1-2 minutes to allow the spices to release their full flavors.
	- remove from heat, cover, and let it rest for 1-2 minutes.
- serving
