- welcome to the autonomy and sustainability knowledge graph
- created by [[rockets]]
- for [[citadel genesis]] district of [[cyber valley]]
-
- we are building autonomous community in bali mountains on ~40 ha
- we settled here 1 year ago to learn how to live autonomously
- think of this knowledge graph is a book
- that summarize our experience on this way
-
- it is young, but improving fast
- you can make it better
-
- the purpose of this book is to help you build your autonomous community everywhere!
- with such knowledge
	- you can establish very comfortable independent life
	- in the most beautiful places on earth
	- at extremely low cost which can be less when price of average car
-
- if you are interested in practical experience we launch [[bootcamp]] in november
	- 2 week intensive training
	- 10 days of complete offline
	- theory, mentorship and participation in real process
-
- what is sytech?
	- sytech is rooted to [[philosophy of harmonious complexity]]
	- on top of which we develop this design framework for fusing societies, biomes, technology, and architecture
	- this knowledge graph is semantic setting for [[autonomy]], [[prosperity]] and [[evolution]]
- sytech is practical design framework
	- [[intro to autonomy]]: complex can be simple
	- [[energy system]]: how to build and make it work reliably?
	- [[water system]]: simple solutions for clean water
	- [[soil, heat and recycling]]: the source of magic
	- [[biome engineering]]: create efficient and high margin [[magic forest]]
	- [[longevity and health]]: simple secrets for better life
	- [[cryptography and web3]]: confident use of modern apps
	- [[learning and ai]]: knowledge graphs and prompt engineering basics
	- [[lowtech construction]]: building fast and cheap
	- [[sensors, dev and control]]: how to automate and lead community
