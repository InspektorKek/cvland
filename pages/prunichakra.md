- discover the rejuvenating practice of prunichakra—a harmonious blend of physical effort and mindful connection with nature. much like tai chi, prunichakra encourages smooth, intentional movements, from cutting and reaching to twisting and balancing. as you engage your arms, shoulders, and core in the act of pruning, you build strength, coordination, and flexibility. more than just a workout, it fosters a deep relationship with the natural world, enhancing your mental clarity and reducing stress. pruning offers a meditative rhythm as you shape and care for the plants around you, bringing both your garden and inner self into balance. no fancy gym equipment or membership required—just a pair of shears, the open air, and your intention. embrace prunichakra as a natural way to stay fit, grounded, and connected to the earth, transforming both your surroundings and your well-being in the process.

- #### **cutting branches with pruning shears**
	- **muscles involved**: flexor [[digitorum superficialis]], [[biceps brachii]], [[triceps brachii]], [[deltoids]] , [[trapezius]], and [[rhomboids]].
	- **description**: cutting through branches with pruning shears requires grip strength from the **flexor digitorum superficialis** (forearm flexor muscles) and hand muscles. the **biceps brachii** and **triceps brachii** help control the opening and closing motion of the shears, while the **deltoid** (shoulder muscle), **trapezius**, and **rhomboids** (upper back muscles) provide stability and power during the cutting motion, keeping your upper body steady.
- #### **using loppers for thicker branches**
	- **muscles involved**: flexor digitorum profundus, biceps brachii, triceps brachii, deltoid, pectoralis major, rectus abdominis, and obliques.
	- **description**: lopping thicker branches engages both arms and upper body muscles. the **flexor digitorum profundus** (forearm muscles) and **biceps brachii** are heavily involved in gripping and squeezing the handles, while the **triceps brachii** assist in the pushing motion. the **deltoid** (shoulders) and **pectoralis major** (chest) help to apply force, while the **rectus abdominis** and **obliques** (core muscles) stabilize your body during the effort.
- #### **reaching overhead with pole pruners**
	- **muscles involved**: deltoid, trapezius, rhomboids, biceps brachii, triceps brachii, rectus abdominis, and obliques.
	- **description**: reaching overhead to prune higher branches activates the **deltoid** (shoulder muscles) and **trapezius** and **rhomboids** (upper back muscles) to keep your arm lifted and stable. the **biceps brachii** and **triceps brachii** work to manipulate the pole pruner, while the **rectus abdominis** and **obliques** (core muscles) stabilize your body during the stretching and cutting motions.
- #### **twisting and turning to reach hidden branches**
	- **muscles involved**: rectus abdominis, obliques, erector spinae, quadriceps, and hamstrings.
	- **description**: pruning in awkward positions or reaching difficult angles engages the **rectus abdominis** and **obliques** (core muscles), allowing for twisting motions. the **erector spinae** (lower back muscles) support your spine during rotation, and the **quadriceps** and **hamstrings** (leg muscles) assist in maintaining balance while twisting.
- #### **gripping and holding tools**
	- **muscles involved**: flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor pollicis longus, flexor carpi radialis, biceps brachii, and deltoid.
	- **description**: maintaining a firm grip on pruning tools involves the **flexor digitorum superficialis**, **flexor pollicis longus**, and **flexor carpi radialis** (hand and forearm muscles). the **biceps brachii** and **deltoid** provide additional support for sustained control and balance while using the tools for prolonged periods.
