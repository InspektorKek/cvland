- **alias**: methionine
- ![Methionine.pdf](../assets/Methionine_1719303309556_0.pdf)
- [[methionine]] is an essential sulfur-containing [[amino acid]] found in protein-rich foods like [[meat]], [[fish]], [[eggs]], and [[nuts]]. it plays a vital role in [[protein synthesis]], [[detoxification]], and overall [[metabolic health]]
- ### chemical properties
	- **molecular weight**: 149.21 g/mol
	- **density**: 1.34 g/cm³
	- **melting point**: 281°C (decomposes)
	- **solubility**: soluble in water; slightly soluble in alcohol
	- **chemical formula**: C₅H₁₁NO₂S
- ### usefulness in medicine
	- methionine is a precursor for [[glutathione]], a powerful [[antioxidant]] that protects cells from oxidative stress.
	- it aids in [[liver detoxification]] by facilitating the removal of heavy metals and other toxins.
	- methionine supports [[skin health]] and strengthens [[hair and nails]] by providing [[sulfur]] for [[keratin production]].
	- it helps regulate [[fat metabolism]] by preventing fat buildup in the [[liver]].
	- methionine plays a role in the synthesis of important molecules like [[S-adenosylmethionine]] (SAMe), which supports [[mental health]] and [[reduces inflammation]].
- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- methionine itself does not exhibit direct antimicrobial properties but supports immune function and detoxification processes, indirectly aiding in infection control.
