- Sengon (Albizia chinensis) is a type of tree belonging to the Fabaceae family. This shade and wood-producing tree is naturally distributed in India, Southeast Asia, southern China and Indonesia.[1]
- In some areas, this tree is known as sengon, singon, sengon jåwå (Jw.); jeungjing, Sundanese jeungjing (Sd.); séngghung (Md.; marĕwita, keura Sumba,[2] and others. In English it is known as silk tree, Chinese albizia; in addition, this tree is also named: kōōl (Cambodia), kha:ng (Laos), khang hung, kang Luang (Thai), cham (Vietnamese), and others.[1]
- Introduction
- Stems and pepagan
  Trees that shed their leaves; medium to tall, 30–45 m, and the trunk is 70(–140) cm. Pepagan is rather smooth, dark gray outside, with transverse teeth, lenticels, thin; inner pepagan 5 mm thick, pink. The young twigs are faceted and hairy.[1]
- Compound leaves are doubly pinnate, with 4–14 pairs of fins; Main leaf veins 10–25 cm, hairy, with glands near the base of the leaf stalk and at the junction of the fin bones.[1] The stem leaves are large, obliquely oval with a semi-heart-shaped base, membrane-like, with a tail at the tip; fall out quickly.[3][4] Fins 4–14 cm long, with 10–45 leaflets per fin, sitting, opposite.[1] The leaflets are elongated to a line shape, with pointed tips, slanted, blue-green underside, 6–13 × 1.5–4 mm, middle leaf vein very close to the upper edge.[4]
- Compound flowers are in the form of bulbs with stems, which are collected again to form panicles 15–30 cm long.[4] The head contains 10–20 flowers.[3] Flowers number-5; with toothed petals, lk height 4 mm, hairy; funnel-shaped crown tube, yellow green, LK height 7 mm, hairy.[4] Stamens 10 or more, lk 3 cm long, white, above green, the bases are fused to form a tube, which is more or less as high as the crown.[4] Pods 10–18 cm × 2–3.5 cm long, do not open, broken irregularly.[4] Seeds are flat, oblong, 7 × 4–5 mm.[3][4]
- Ecology and distribution
- Legumes
  Sengon is found naturally in mixed deciduous forests in humid and sunny areas, with rainfall between 1,000–5,000 mm per year. This tree is also found in secondary forests, along river banks, and in savannas, up to an altitude of 1,800 m above sea level. Sengon adapts well to poor, high pH or salt-containing soils; also grows well in lateritic alluvial soil and sandy soil from former mines.[5]
- The natural distribution of sengon includes India, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, China, Vietnam and Indonesia; introduced to Australia. In Indonesia, sengon spreads in Java, Bali and Nusa Tenggara; brought in and cultivated in Sumatra and Kalimantan.[5]
- Benefit
  Wood
  Sengon produces light to somewhat light wood, with a density of 320–640 kg/m³ at a moisture content of 15%.[6] Rather dense, straight grained and somewhat rough, but easy to work with. The heartwood is shiny yellow to brown-red-ivory; Its strength and durability are classified into strong class III–IV and durable class III–IV.[2] This wood is not attacked by subterranean termites, because of the extractive substances contained in the wood.[1] However, burial trials in the Philippines found that A. chinensis sengon wood only lasted 16 months, while A. saponaria langir wood lasted up to 3 years and A. procera weru wood even up to 10 years.[6]
- Sengon wood is usually used to make chests, boats, houses and bridges.[2] In Sabah, A. chinensis wood is traded as 'batai' wood, mixed with A. pedicellata and Paraserianthes falcataria wood.[6]
- Agroforestry
  On coffee and tea plantations, A. chinensis is often planted for shade; especially in mixtures with jeunjing (P. falcataria) and dadap (Erythrina spp.). Sengon is liked as an ornamental and shade plant for parks, gardens and roadsides. This tree is also planted to protect sloping land and to improve the soil.[1] Sengon roots fix nitrogen.[5]
- Other uses
  Like ki hiang bark, pepagan sengon contains ingredients that can be used to anesthetize fish in rivers. In the past, this pepagan was also used as a soap ingredient.[2]
- Even though the leaves are eaten by goats, the skin of the branches is poisonous because it contains saponin.[1]
- Similar type
  The appearance and wood of Paraserianthes falcataria are more or less similar to the sengon tree and wood, so the names are often interchanged. By the Javanese, P. falcataria — which originates from Maluku — is called sengon sea, sengon sabrang, or sengon landi.
