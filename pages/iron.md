- ### usefulness in medicine
	- iron is used to treat and prevent [[iron deficiency anemia]], a condition characterized by fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
	- it supports [[oxygen transport]] in the body and promotes energy production.
	- iron is essential for [[immune function]] and helps combat infections.
	- it contributes to [[healthy skin]] by supporting cell repair and regeneration, reducing dryness, and preventing brittle nails.
- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- iron does not directly act as an antimicrobial agent but plays a critical role in immune defense by supporting the growth and activity of immune cells. however, excess iron can promote the growth of certain pathogens.
