- klebsiella pneumoniae is a gram-negative bacterium that is part of the normal flora of the human intestines but can cause a range of infections, particularly in healthcare settings. it is known for its ability to cause severe infections and its increasing resistance to antibiotics.
- **diseases caused by klebsiella pneumoniae:**
	- 1. **[[pneumonia]]:** can cause severe, often hospital-acquired pneumonia, leading to lung abscesses and pleural effusions.
	- 2. **[[urinary tract infections]] (utis):** commonly causes utis, especially in people with urinary catheters or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract.
	- 3. **[[bloodstream infections]] ([[bacteremia]]):** can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening systemic response to infection.
	- 4. **[[wound or surgical site infections]]:** often occurs in post-surgical patients or those with open wounds.
	- 5. **[[liver abscesses]]:** klebsiella can lead to abscess formation in the liver, particularly in diabetic or immunocompromised individuals.
	- 6. **[[meningitis]]:** though less common, it can cause meningitis, particularly in neonates or immunocompromised individuals.
- **habitats and transmission:**
	- **human body:** normally found in the intestines but can colonize the skin, throat, and gastrointestinal tract.
	- **environment:** can be found in soil, water, and hospital environments, particularly on medical equipment and surfaces.
	- **transmission:** primarily occurs through direct contact with contaminated surfaces, equipment, or person-to-person contact, particularly in healthcare settings.
- klebsiella pneumoniae is a significant cause of hospital-acquired infections and is concerning due to its ability to acquire and transmit antibiotic resistance genes, leading to multi-drug-resistant strains. prevention strategies include strict hand hygiene, proper sterilization of medical equipment, and careful use of antibiotics to prevent the spread of resistant strains. treatment often requires the use of powerful antibiotics, and in cases of resistant infections, combination therapy or newer antibiotics may be necessary.
