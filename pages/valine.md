- [[valine]] is an essential branched-chain [[amino acid]]  (bcaa) found in protein-rich foods such as [[meat]], [[dairy]], [[soy]], and [[legumes]]. it plays a critical role in [[muscle growth]], [[energy production]], and [[tissue repair]].
- ### chemical properties
	- **molecular weight**: 117.15 g/mol
	- **density**: 1.23 g/cm³
	- **melting point**: 315°C (decomposes)
	- **solubility**: soluble in water; slightly soluble in alcohol
	- **chemical formula**: C₅H₁₁NO₂
- ### usefulness in medicine
	- valine is essential for [[muscle protein synthesis]] and repair, making it vital for athletes and individuals recovering from injuries.
	- it helps maintain [[energy levels]] during exercise by serving as a [[fuel source for [[muscle cells]]]].
	- valine supports the [[nervous system]] by assisting in neurotransmitter synthesis.
	- it plays a role in managing [[stress]] and promoting [[mental clarity]].
	- valine is important in [[wound healing]] and overall tissue growth.
- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- valine itself does not exhibit direct antimicrobial effects but [[contributes to immune health]] and [[cellular repair]], indirectly aiding the body’s defense mechanisms.
