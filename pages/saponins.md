- **alias**: saponins

- [[saponins]] are a class of naturally occurring [[glycosides]] found in a variety of plants, including [[legumes]], [[quinoa]], and [[herbs]]. they are known for their [[foaming properties]], [[antioxidant]] activity, and numerous health benefits, including [[antimicrobial]] and [[cholesterol-lowering]] effects.
- ### chemical properties
	- **molecular structure**: composed of a [[hydrophobic aglycone]] ([[sapogenin]]) and one or more [[hydrophilic sugar]] chains.
	- **molecular weight**: varies widely depending on the specific saponin.
	- **density**: not widely reported.
	- **melting point**: decomposes before melting.
	- **solubility**: soluble in water and ethanol; **foams when dissolved in water**.
- ### usefulness in medicine
	- saponins are used to lower [[cholesterol]] levels by binding to bile acids and preventing their reabsorption.
	- they exhibit strong [[antioxidant]] properties, protecting cells from oxidative stress.
	- saponins support [[immune health]] by enhancing immune cell activity.
	- they promote [[gut health]] by inhibiting harmful bacteria and supporting a healthy microbiome.
	- saponins are used in traditional medicine for treating [[inflammation]], [[respiratory issues]], and [[skin conditions]].
- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- saponins show broad-spectrum [[antimicrobial]] activity by [[disrupting microbial membranes]] and interfering with their growth and function.
