alias:: asian honeybee

- This species is native to South, Southeast Asia, and parts of East Asia. *Apis cerana* is smaller than *Apis mellifera* and adapts well to various ecological environments. They nest in cavities and have been traditionally kept in hives for honey production in some Asian countries. Their behavior and social structure are similar to that of the domesticated honeybee.
