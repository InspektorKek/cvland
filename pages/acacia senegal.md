- ### review of acacia senegal
- acacia senegal, commonly known as gum arabic tree, is a small to medium-sized tree native to africa. it is valued for its gum arabic, which is harvested from its trunk and branches. it plays a key role in nitrogen fixation and soil improvement in permaculture systems. in landscaping valued for its ornamental beauty and drought tolerance. environmental benefits, such as carbon sequestration and water conservation.
- ### useful parts and their products:
- **products**:
	- **root**: roots are generally not harvested for commercial use, but they contribute to soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation.
	- **stem**: stems produce gum arabic, which is used in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. valuable timber used in construction and furniture making.
	- **fruit**: fruits are pods that contain seeds. they are not commonly used commercially but can be a source of feed for livestock.
	- **leaves**: leaves can be used as fodder for livestock. edible greens rich in nutrients.
	- **bark**: bark is used to produce gum arabic and has traditional medicinal uses.
	- **flower**: flowers attract pollinators and can be used in traditional medicine.
- **uses**:
	- **plants/fruits**: fruits are mainly used as livestock feed.
	- **plants/greens**: leaves are used as fodder.
	- **plants/nuts**: seeds can be used as feed.
	- **plants/flowers**: flowers are used in traditional medicine.
	- **plants/resins**: [[gum arabic]], a natural [[exudate]], is the primary product, used in various industries, in the food, beverage (as a stabilizer and emulsifier), pharmaceuticals (as a binder in tablets), and cosmetics (as a thickening agent).
	- **plants/medicine**: treating [[wounds]] and [[cough]], [[sore throat]], [[diarrhea]]
	- **plants/fuel**: the wood can be used as a source of fuel for cooking and heating
	- **plants/timber**: the strong and durable timber, highly valued for construction and furniture making
	- **plants/fertilizer**: leaves and pods can be used as green manure. a nitrogen-fixing plant that improves soil fertility and benefits neighboring plants
- **data**:
	- **sun requirements**: full sun
	- **water requirements**: drought-tolerant, requires minimal watering once established
	- **soil ph**: tolerates a wide range of soils, preferably slightly acidic to neutral (ph 6-7)
	- **plant roles in permaculture guilds**: acacia senegal is a nitrogen-fixing plant, improving soil fertility. it provides shade, windbreaks, and habitat for beneficial insects. it also aids in water retention and soil stabilization.
	- **height in meters**: 5-12 meters
	- **spacing in meters**: 3-4 meters apart for optimal growth
	- **germination days**: 10-20 days
	- **strata**: mid to upper strata in agroforestry systems
	- **days to maturity**: approximately 4-5 years to start producing gum arabic
	- **plant, harvest, pruning calendar in months**:
		- **planting**: start seeds in the rainy season
		- **harvesting**: gum arabic is harvested from december to june
		- **pruning**: prune annually to maintain shape and health
	- **good neighbors**: other nitrogen-fixing plants, crops that benefit from partial shade, and plants that attract pollinators
	- **bad neighbors**: plants sensitive to competition for water and nutrients
