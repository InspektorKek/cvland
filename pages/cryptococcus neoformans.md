- cryptococcus neoformans is a pathogenic yeast (fungus) that primarily affects individuals with weakened immune systems. it is known for causing serious infections, particularly in people with hiv/aids, but can also affect those with other immunocompromising conditions.
	- **diseases caused by cryptococcus neoformans:**
		- 1. **cryptococcosis:** a broad term for infections caused by this yeast, which can affect various parts of the body.
			- **[[cryptococcal meningitis]]:** the most common and serious form, involving infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. symptoms include headache, fever, neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status.
			- **[[pulmonary cryptococcosis]]:** infection of the lungs, leading to cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, and fever. it can mimic pneumonia or tuberculosis.
			- **[[cutaneous cryptococcosis]]:** skin infections presenting as [[ulcers]], [[nodules]], or [[papules]], often on the face and neck.
			- **[[disseminated cryptococcosis]]:** occurs when the infection spreads from the lungs to other parts of the body, including the skin, bones, and organs.
	- **habitats and transmission:**
		- **environment:** found in soil, particularly soil contaminated with bird droppings (especially pigeons), and in decaying wood and tree hollows.
		- **transmission:** primarily occurs through inhalation of airborne fungal spores from the environment. it is not transmitted from person to person.
	- preventing cryptococcus neoformans infections involves avoiding exposure to environments likely to harbor the fungus, especially for individuals with weakened immune systems. in healthcare settings, protective measures may include the use of masks and avoiding areas with high concentrations of bird droppings.
	- treatment of cryptococcosis typically involves antifungal medications. for mild to moderate pulmonary infections, fluconazole or itraconazole may be used. for severe pulmonary infections or cryptococcal meningitis, a combination of amphotericin b and flucytosine is often administered, followed by a prolonged course of fluconazole. early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to improve outcomes, especially for cryptococcal meningitis, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
