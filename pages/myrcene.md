- **general description about myrcene:**
	- myrcene is a naturally occurring [[monoterpene]] hydrocarbon found in essential oils of various plants such as [[bay]], [[ylang-ylang]], [[wild thyme]], [[parsley]], and [[cannabis]]. it has a pleasant aroma often described as earthy, musky, and herbal with hints of citrus. myrcene is widely used in the fragrance and flavor industry.
- **chemical properties:**
	- **molecular weight**: 136.24 g/mol
	- **density**: 0.794 g/cm³
	- **boiling point**: 166-168 °c (331-334 °f)
	- **solubility**: insoluble in water, soluble in alcohol and oils
	- **optical rotation**: typically not specified for myrcene as it is not chiral
	- **chemical formula**: C10H16
- **usefulness in medicine:**
	- myrcene is noted for its [[analgesic effects]] (pain-relieving), [[anti-inflammatory]] [[sedative]] , and [[anti-cancer]] properties. it also enhances the absorption of other [[terpenes]] and [[cannabinoids]], contributing to the [[entourage effect in cannabis]] products. myrcene is being studied for its potential therapeutic benefits in pain management and inflammation reduction.
