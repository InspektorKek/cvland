- **alias**: potassium
- ![Potassium.pdf](../assets/Potassium_1719303309556_0.pdf)
- [[potassium]] is a vital [[mineral]] and [[electrolyte]] essential for maintaining [[fluid balance]], [[proper nerve signaling]], and [[muscle contraction]]. it plays a critical role in [[heart function]], [[cellular metabolism]], and [[overall health]].
- ### chemical properties
	- **molecular weight**: 39.10 g/mol
	- **density**: 0.89 g/cm³
	- **melting point**: 63.5°C (146.3°F)
	- **boiling point**: 759°C (1398°F)
	- **solubility**: highly reactive with water, forming potassium hydroxide (KOH)
	- **chemical formula**: K
- ### usefulness in medicine
	- potassium is essential for preventing and managing [[hypokalemia]] (low potassium levels), which can cause [[muscle weakness]], [[cramps]], and [[irregular heart rhythms]].
	- it helps regulate [[blood pressure]] by counteracting the effects of sodium and maintaining fluid balance.
	- potassium supports [[muscle contraction]] and [[nerve function]], ensuring proper communication between cells.
	- it plays a role in maintaining healthy skin by promoting [[hydration]] and supporting [[cellular repair]].
- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- potassium itself does not exhibit direct antimicrobial activity but supports the immune system and [[skin barrier function]], indirectly enhancing the body’s defense mechanisms.
