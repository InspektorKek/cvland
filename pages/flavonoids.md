- **alias**: flavonoids
- ![Flavonoids.pdf](../assets/Flavonoids_1719303309556_0.pdf)
- [[flavonoids]] are a group of natural compounds found in fruits, vegetables, teas, and other plant-based foods. they are known for their strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulating properties, playing a key role in promoting overall health and protecting against chronic diseases.
- ### chemical properties
- **molecular structure**: based on a 15-carbon skeleton (C₆-C₃-C₆) with two aromatic rings connected by a three-carbon bridge.
- **molecular weight**: varies depending on the specific flavonoid (e.g., quercetin: 302.24 g/mol, kaempferol: 286.23 g/mol).
- **solubility**: most flavonoids are poorly soluble in water; soluble in organic solvents like ethanol and DMSO.
- ### usefulness in medicine
- flavonoids act as potent [[antioxidants]], neutralizing free radicals and reducing [[oxidative stress]].
- they exhibit [[anti-inflammatory]] properties, helping manage conditions like [[arthritis]], [[cardiovascular diseases]], and [[diabetes]].
- flavonoids support [[skin health]] by protecting against uv damage, reducing inflammation, and promoting collagen synthesis.
- they are being studied for their [[anticancer]] properties, as they can inhibit tumor cell proliferation and induce apoptosis.
- flavonoids improve [[brain health]], potentially lowering the risk of [[neurodegenerative diseases]] like Alzheimer's.
- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity  
  flavonoids are known for their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, targeting bacteria, fungi, and viruses by disrupting microbial membranes, inhibiting enzyme activity, and modulating immune responses. research highlights:
