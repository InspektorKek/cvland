- The amount of labor required to manage 1 hectare of rice field can vary significantly depending on several factors such as the level of mechanization, the type of rice cultivation (e.g., irrigated, rain-fed, or upland), and local farming practices. However, I can provide a general estimate based on traditional methods often used in regions like Bali where manual labor is still prevalent.
- 1. **Land Preparation**: This includes plowing, leveling, and sometimes applying fertilizers. It typically requires about 8 to 12 hours per hectare, depending on the tools used (manual labor or mechanized).
- 2. **Planting**: Manual transplanting of rice seedlings can take about 30 to 40 human hours per hectare. Direct seeding might reduce the labor but requires different preparation and care.
- 3. **Weeding and Crop Care**: This includes multiple weeding sessions and applying fertilizers or pesticides. This could require about 25 to 30 hours per hectare spread out over several weeks.
- 4. **Harvesting**: Manual harvesting, including cutting, gathering, and initial processing, is labor-intensive, requiring about 30 to 40 hours per hectare.
- 5. **Post-harvest Processing**: This includes threshing, drying, and storing the rice. The labor here can vary but typically takes about 15 to 20 hours per hectare.
- Adding these up, managing 1 hectare of rice manually can require approximately 108 to 152 human hours across the growing season. These estimates assume traditional manual methods without significant mechanical assistance. In more mechanized farming setups, the labor hours required could be significantly lower.

- To answer your questions about how much rice the average Balinese person consumes in a year, how much land is needed to produce this amount of rice, and how many times rice can be harvested per season in Bali, we need to consider several factors:
  
  1. **Average Rice Consumption**: The average rice consumption per person in Indonesia is quite high. While specific data for Bali might vary slightly, it's common across Indonesia for individuals to consume around 139 kg of rice per person per year.
  
  2. **Rice Yield per Hectare in Bali**: Rice yields can vary widely depending on the specific type of rice, cultivation practices, and environmental conditions. In Indonesia, and specifically in regions like Bali that may use intensive cultivation methods, average yields can be around 5 tons per hectare per harvest.
  
  3. **Number of Harvests per Season**: In Bali, the rice growing cycle allows for multiple harvests in a year. Typically, farmers in Bali can manage to harvest rice two to three times a year, depending on the variety and the specific agricultural practices used. The use of irrigation and the subak system (a traditional cooperative water management system) support this intensive cultivation.
  
  To calculate how much land is required to support one person's annual rice consumption in Bali, given the yield and the number of harvests, we can use the following formula:
  
  \[
  \text{Land Required (ha)} = \frac{\text{Annual Consumption (kg)}}{\text{Yield (kg/ha/year)}}
  \]
  
  Where the yield per year is calculated by multiplying the yield per harvest by the number of harvests per year:
  
  \[
  \text{Yield per year} = \text{Yield per harvest} \times \text{Number of harvests per year}
  \]
  
  Let's assume:
- Yield per harvest = 5,000 kg/ha (5 tons)
- Number of harvests per year = 3
  
  \[
  \text{Yield per year} = 5,000 \, \text{kg/ha} \times 3 = 15,000 \, \text{kg/ha/year}
  \]
  
  \[
  \text{Land Required (ha)} = \frac{139 \, \text{kg}}{15,000 \, \text{kg/ha/year}} \approx 0.0093 \, \text{ha}
  \]
  
  So, for an average person in Bali, approximately 0.0093 hectares (or 93 square meters) of rice paddy is needed to produce the annual consumption of rice. This calculation assumes optimal growing conditions and typical yields, and actual requirements can vary based on local conditions and practices.
