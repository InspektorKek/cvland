### cheese storage guide
	- temperature
		- store cheese at +2 to +8°c; hard cheeses at +4 to +6°c, soft cheeses at +2 to +4°c.
	- packaging
		- use parchment or wax paper; avoid plastic bags to prevent moisture buildup.
	- humidity control
		- maintain moderate humidity; for soft cheese, use an airtight container with a sugar cube or damp cloth.
	- separate storage
		- keep cheese away from strong-smelling foods; store blue cheese separately to prevent mold spread.
	- shelf life
		- fresh cheese (ricotta, mozzarella) – 3-7 days
		- soft cheese (brie, camembert) – up to 2 weeks
		- semi-hard cheese (gouda, cheddar) – 2-4 weeks
		- hard cheese (parmesan, gruyère) – 1-3 months
	- serving
		- take cheese out 30-60 minutes before serving for better flavor; use a clean knife to avoid mixing flavors.
	- if mold appears
		- hard/semi-hard cheese – cut off 1-2 cm around the mold, rewrap in fresh paper, store in the fridge.
		- soft/fresh cheese – discard if mold appears, as it can penetrate inside.
		- blue cheese – if mold changes color or smells bad, discard.
		- if cheese is still usable but aging, grate it, store in airtight bags, and freeze for up to 3 months.
