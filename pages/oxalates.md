- **alias**: oxalates, oxalic acid salts

- [[oxalates]] are naturally occurring organic compounds found in many plants, including vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds. they are salts or esters of oxalic acid and are commonly associated with calcium to form calcium oxalate.
- ### chemical properties
	- **molecular weight**: 88.02 g/mol (oxalic acid), variable for salts (e.g., calcium oxalate: 128.1 g/mol).
	- **density**: 1.65 g/cm³ (oxalic acid).
	- **melting point**: oxalic acid decomposes at ~189°C.
	- **solubility**: oxalates are water-soluble in certain forms (e.g., sodium oxalate); calcium oxalate is poorly soluble.
	- **chemical formula**: (C₂O₄)²⁻
- ### usefulness in medicine
	- **[[diagnostic marker]]**: elevated oxalate levels in urine can indicate metabolic disorders or diseases like [[kidney stones]] and [[hyperoxaluria]].
	- **[[antinutritional effects]]**: oxalates can bind to minerals like calcium and magnesium in the digestive tract, reducing their absorption.
	- **medical research**: oxalates are studied for their role in forming [[calcium oxalate kidney stones]] and potential ways to prevent or dissolve them.
- ### natural sources of oxalates
	- **high-oxalate foods**:
		- [[spinach]], [[beet greens]], [[rhubarb]], [[chard]].
		- [[nuts]]: [[almonds]], [[cashews]].
		- [[grains]]: buckwheat, quinoa.
		- [[vegetables]]: potatoes, sweet potatoes.
	- **low-oxalate alternatives**: lettuce, cucumber, zucchini.
- ### risks and considerations
	- **kidney stones**: high oxalate intake is associated with the formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones. individuals with a history of stones should limit high-oxalate foods.
	- **toxicity**: excessive consumption of raw high-oxalate plants (e.g., raw taro leaves) can cause irritation and toxicity, leading to symptoms like burning sensations in the mouth or throat.
	- **management**: cooking and boiling foods high in oxalates can reduce their oxalate content. pairing high-oxalate foods with calcium-rich foods can help reduce oxalate absorption.
- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- oxalates themselves do not exhibit antimicrobial properties but can influence microbial activity in specific environments, such as the gut, by altering calcium availability.
