- [[leucine]] is an essential [[branched-chain amino acid]]  (bcaa) found in protein-rich foods such as [[meat]], [[dairy]], [[eggs]], and [[legumes]]. it is crucial for [[muscle protein synthesis]], [[energy production]], and overall [[metabolic health]].
- ### chemical properties
	- **molecular weight**: 131.17 g/mol
	- **density**: 1.293 g/cm³
	- **melting point**: 293°C (decomposes)
	- **solubility**: soluble in water and acids; slightly soluble in alcohol
	- **chemical formula**: C₆H₁₃NO₂
- ### usefulness in medicine
	- leucine plays a central role in [[muscle protein synthesis]] and is vital for muscle repair and growth, making it **popular among athletes and bodybuilders**.
- it supports [[wound healing]] by promoting tissue regeneration.
- leucine helps regulate [[blood sugar levels]] by improving insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake.
- it contributes to [[energy production]] during exercise by being metabolized in muscles.
- leucine may slow the progression of [[age-related muscle loss]] (sarcopenia) by stimulating muscle protein synthesis.
- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- while leucine does not have direct antimicrobial activity, it indirectly supports immune function and tissue health, which are critical for fighting infections.
