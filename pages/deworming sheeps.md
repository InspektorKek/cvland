- 1. stop feeding sheeps inside their home. most of parasites come from fecal mass
  2. every day you must start from moving sheeps to the place with meal, and move them back at the end of the day
  3. you must clean their home
  4. you must start feed sheeps with the following
- garlic - we have a bit at home - lets try first before bying more
- ginger - you must find fresh ginger somewhere in the gardens of forest
- tumeric - we have some at home
- neem oil - we have some at home
- do not feed inside
- feed with [diatomite](https://www.tokopedia.com/niochemical/dicalite-diatomite-diatomaceous-earth-powder-1kg?extParam=ivf%3Dfalse%26src%3Dsearch)
- neem: extracts from the neem tree have been used for their antiparasitic, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. Neem is thought to disrupt the life cycle of parasites.
- garlic: contains allicin and ajoene, compounds known for their broad-spectrum antiparasitic effects against both internal and external parasites.
- turmeric: contains curcumin, a compound with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anthelmintic effects.
- pumpkin seeds: rich in cucurbitacin, which has been shown to paralyze worms, making them easily expelled from the gut.
- papaya seeds: the enzyme papain in papaya seeds has been reported to have anthelmintic effects, helping to expel worms from the digestive system.
- diatomaceous earth: a fine powder made from the fossilized remains of diatoms. It's believed to act mechanically, puncturing the exoskeletons of parasites and causing them to dehydrate and die.
- fennel seeds: known for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties, fennel seeds are also believed to have a mild deworming effect.
- wormwood (artemisia absinthium): traditionally used for its antiparasitic properties, particularly against gastrointestinal worms. However, caution is advised due to its potential toxicity in high doses.
- tansy (tanacetum vulgare): has been used historically as an anthelmintic, but like wormwood, it must be used with caution due to potential toxicity.
- chicory (cichorium intybus): contains sesquiterpene lactones, which are thought to have anthelmintic properties. Chicory is also beneficial for overall gut health.
- integrated parasite management
	- drug treatments
	- rotational grazing
	- good sanitation practices
	- regular monitoring of parasite loads through fecal egg counts

- This adjusted table focuses on the frequency of use, the estimated need for a year for a flock of 10 sheep, the typical dosage, and the alternative names for the listed anthelmintics. Always ensure you're consulting with a veterinarian for accurate dosage and the most effective treatment plan for your sheep.
- The "Estimation for 10 Sheep/Year" column provides a rough estimate of the total number of treatments you might need for a flock of 10 sheep, assuming each sheep is treated each time. The range accounts for different dosing intervals recommended for various parasites and conditions.
- Dosages are given in mg/kg; the exact number of pills needed will depend on the concentration of the active ingredient in each pill and the weight of the sheep.
- Some anthelmintics are more commonly used in certain situations than others, and the choice of drug might be influenced by factors such as the age of the sheep, pregnancy status, and known resistance patterns.
- It's crucial to rotate between different classes of anthelmintics to prevent or slow the development of resistance.
  
  **Consultation with a Veterinarian**:
  Before implementing any deworming program, it's essential to consult with a veterinarian. A professional can provide advice tailored to your specific situation, including the selection of the most appropriate anthelmintic, the correct dosage, and the optimal treatment schedule based on the parasite risk and resistance patterns in your area.
