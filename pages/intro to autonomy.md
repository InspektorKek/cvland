- design for autonomy
	- understand your resources
		- capital
		- geographic location
		- people
		- landscape
		- solar drop
		- water gain
		- wind flows
		- elements in soil
		- species
		- unique features
	- understand your problems
		- extremely specific
		- our case
			- zero infrastructure: chicken and egg problem
			- gap between local physical force and foreign intellectual force
			- lack of capital
			- local features
			  id:: 67036113-1801-49a3-8ef0-5045456021ff
				- motorcycles without a muffler
				- aggressive dogs
				- and poisoned soil (everywhere)
	- priorities for everyone
		- capital reserves
		- energy, water, connection first
		- shelter
			- cheap and fast but hard way: basic shelter => move to place
			- slow, expensive but easy: build capital stuff first => take years
	- outline of development
		- define high level goals, example
		  collapsed:: true
			- debug energy, connection and water system
			- diversify energy with wind
			- provide staple food
			- produce 1 m3 of soil in month
			- heating of the home and water
		- do not decompose goals into small tasks
		- do fast and small things based on the most needed today
		- act consistently: 2-4 hours a day
		- mindset
			- first year is hard
			- second is normal
			- third year is cool
